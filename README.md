The Video Game Trivia is an app where you can test your video game knowledge with easy, medium and hard questions. There is a start screen which is in the style of a retro games that is inspired from the early nes console graphics to give that novelty feeling. 10 quiz questions that are fetched from a API and the questions are different each time you play the quiz.

## Wireframes

**// talk about wireframe of quiz // **

The wireframes were designed using Balsamiq. Designed with mobile first practices, tablet and then website. 
The final design of the Trailblazers site evolved from the original wireframes to create a smoother, more intuitive user experience. While the wireframes helped establish the initial structure—such as homepage layout, events section, and booking form the final version refines these elements for better flow and clarity.

## Design Choices

### Typography
/add more about why i picked the fonts/


The font family chosen for the Video Game Trivia website is Press Start 2P for the primary font. Lato for the secondary font. These were chosen for replicating nes font to give that retro vibe, to bring a nostaligic feeling to the user.


### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen based on colours nes Pacman game. The navy blue background and yellow text mirrors the old style PacMan game which i think is something that a lot of people know of.

I used [Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/ "Contrast Grid") to check effective color pairings that support readability and to identify combinations that may hinder legibility due to insufficient contrast or visual discomfort.
